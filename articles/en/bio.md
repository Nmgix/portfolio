Since 2019, I started studying the web development database (HTML, CSS, JS) on SoloLearn and freeCodeCamp. In parallel, he began studying at KBT in the specialty “Information systems and programming”.

In 2020, I discovered Udemy, bought a couple of courses (React from Nepomnyashchy, NodeJS from Minin, etc.) and in parallel began to make pet projects.

In 2021 (approximately) I began to study TS (Typescript) and gradually replace ordinary JS with it because I like the C# syntax more.
Since the beginning of studying TS until today, I have completely stopped using vanilla JS and am writing applications (front - React and back - NodeJS+Express) only with typings.
